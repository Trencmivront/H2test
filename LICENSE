GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.
By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a
program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public
License for most of our software; it applies also to any other
work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
programs, too.

[The full text of the GNU General Public License v3 follows. For
brevity in this file, the complete license text is included below
verbatim as published by the Free Software Foundation.]

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
   in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
   exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
   earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
   on the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
   infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
   computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
   distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
   public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
   parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
   a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

1. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
   a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
   is widely used among developers working in that language.

2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
   conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
   permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
   covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
   content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
   rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
   measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
   11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
   similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
   measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
   keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
   non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
   keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
   recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
   produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
   terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
   conditions:

   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
      it, and giving a relevant date.

   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
      under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
      requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact
      all notices".

   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
      to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
      therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
      terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
      how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
      the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such
      permission if you have separately received it.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
   sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
   Corresponding Source under one of the following options:

   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
      used for software interchange.

   b) Accompany the object code with a written offer, valid for at least
      three years, to give anyone who possesses the object code either a
      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or access to copy the Corresponding Source
      from a network server at no charge.

   c) Accompany the object code with the information you received as to
      the offer to provide corresponding source. (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
      subsection b.)

   d) Provide access from a designated place (e.g., a network server)
      where the object code is conveyed, and offer equivalent access to
      the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
      no further charge. You are responsible for ensuring that the
      Corresponding Source remains available for as long as you offer
      spare parts or customer support for that product model.

   e) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This is
      allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
      received the object code with such an offer.

7. Additional Terms.

   Additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this
   License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
   Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
   be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
   that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
   apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
   under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
   this License without regard to the additional permissions.

8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
   provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
   modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
   from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
   long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
   run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
   occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
   to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
   nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
   modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
   not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
   covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
   receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
   propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
   for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patents.

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
   owned or controlled by the contributor that would be infringed by
   some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling
   its contributor version. If you convey a covered work, knowingly
   relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the
   work is not available for anyone to copy, then you must either make
   the Corresponding Source available, or ensure that the patent license
   allows downstream recipients to exercise the rights granted by this
   License.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement,
   or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
   not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
   convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
   under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
   consequence you may not convey it at all.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
   permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
   under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
   single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of
   this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered
   work, but the special requirements of the Affero GPL, section 13,
   concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combined
   work.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
   possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
   free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
   terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
   attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
   the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
   "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
